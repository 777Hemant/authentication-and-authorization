# Node.js Authentication and Authorization System with MongoDB and Bcrypt

This project showcases a robust authentication and authorization system, user management, and enhances the overall security and integrity of the application. It uses Node.js, RESTful API, and follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern.

## Features

- **User Registration:** Users can sign up for an account. Input validation is implemented to ensure the provided information is valid.

- **User Login:** Registered users can log in using their credentials. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used to implement authentication and authorization.

- **Authorization:** Certain routes or functionalities are protected and only accessible to authenticated users with the appropriate permissions.

- **User Management:** Admin users can manage user accounts, including creating, updating, and deleting users.

- **Password Hashing:** User passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt to protect user data.

## Tools and Technologies

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Bcrypt for password hashing
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization
